        <p>My name is John, but you can call me JJ. I am 22 years old and live in Roseville, CA.
            Currently, I am taking a coding bootcamp at uc davis and want to become a web developer
            in the future. I have been cooking for a few years and want to change careers to something
            in a better environment. Some things I like to do are playing videogames, modifying cars, cooking,
            and hiking.
